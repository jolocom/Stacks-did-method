# Stack DID method spec

Stacks DID Method Specification

# Abstract

Stacks is a network for decentralized applications where users own their
identities and data. Stacks utilizes a public blockchain to implement a
decentralized [naming
layer](https://docs.blockstack.org/core/naming/introduction.html), which binds
a user's human-readable username to their current public key and a pointer to
their data storage buckets.  The naming layer ensures that names are globally
unique, that names can be arbitrary human-meaningful strings, and that names
are owned and controlled by cryptographic key pairs such that only the owner of
the private key can update the name's associated state. This document describes
a DID method built around the BNS naming layer. It describes how a resolvable
DID can be derived given a BNS name, as well as how these DIDs can be updated,
revoked, and resolved.

# 1. System Overview

The Stacks DID method is specified as part of its [decentralized naming
system](https://docs.stacks.co/build-apps/references/bns) (*BNS*).  Each
Stacks name has one corresponding DIDs, and each Stacks DID corresponds
to exactly one name -- even if the name was revoked by its owner or expired.

Stacks is unique among decentralized identity systems in that it is *not*
anchored to a specific blockchain or DLT implementation.  The system is
designed from the ground up to be portable, and has already been live-migrated
from the Namecoin blockchain to the Bitcoin blockchain.  The operational ethos
of Stacks is to leverage the must secure blockchain at all times -- that
is, the one that is considered hardest to attack.

The Stacks naming system and the derived DIDs transcend the underlying
blockchain, and will continue to resolve to DID documents even if the system
migrates to a new blockchain in the future.

## 1.1 DID Lifecycle

Understanding how Stacks DIDs operate requires understanding how the Stacks
naming layer operates. Fundamentally, a Stacks DID is defined as a pointer to a
*BNS name registered by an address*. The lifecycle of a Stacks DID is
therefore tied to the lifecycle of it's underlying BNS name.

The Stacks naming system differentiates between two types of names (and by
extension, two types of resulting DIDs), *on-chain* and *off-chain* (elaborated
on in the following subsections). Both on-chain and off-chain names (as well as
the resulting DIDs) can be resolved to a set of singing keys, as well as
additional metadata, using the BNS smart contract, and the Gaia storage
network, as outlined in section [3.2](#32-resolving-a-stacks-did).

## 1.2 On-chain DIDs

*On-chain DIDs* are based on [BNS
names](https://docs.stacks.co/build-apps/references/bns#organization-of-bns),
the records for which are stored directly on the Stacks blockchain, and managed
/ updated via interactions with the BNS smart contract. BNS names (and by
extension on-chain DIDs) can be registered / updated and revoked by calling the
appropriate functions on the deployed contract. Sections
[3.1.1](#311-on-chain-names), [3.3.1](#331-unpdating-an-on-chain-stacks-did)
and [3.4](#34-deactivating-a-stacks-did) outline the respective interactions in
more detail.

A resolvable Stacks DID can be derived for any on-chain name by concatenating
two pieces of information:

- The address of the name owner, e.g.
  `SP6G7N19FKNW24XH5JQ5P5WR1DN10QWMKMF1WMB3`
- The identifier of the Stacks transaction which registered the on-chain name,
  e.g. `d27cb8d9cd4a9f21b1582c5c89a0d303aa613261ad41b729b48bf714f9cd1a02`

The resulting DID -
`did:stack:v2:SP6G7N19FKNW24XH5JQ5P5WR1DN10QWMKMF1WMB3-d27cb8d9cd4a9f21b1582c5c89a0d303aa613261ad41b729b48bf714f9cd1a02`
contains enough information to map it to one corresponding BNS name. The BNS
contract can be used to retrieve and verify the public keys associated with the
BNS name (and by extension the DID) during the resolution process (as outlined
in section [3.2](#32-resolving-a-stacks-did)).

## 1.3 Off-chain DIDs

Off-chain DIDs are based on [BNS
subdomains](https://docs.stacks.co/build-apps/references/bns#subdomains), the
records for which are stored entirely off-chain, but are collectively anchored
to the blockchain. The ownership and state for these names lives within the P2P
network data and can be retrieved using the Atlas peer network.

Like their on-chain counterparts, subdomains are globally unique, strongly
owned, and human-readable. BNS gives them their own name state and public keys.

Unlike on-chain names, subdomains can be created, updated and revoked cheaply,
because they are broadcast to the BNS network in batches (as described in
sections [3.1.2](#312-registering-off-chain-names),
[3.3.2](#332-updating-an-off-chain-did) and
[3.4](#34-deactivating-a-stacks-did).

An off-chain DID is similarly structured to an on-chain DID. Like on-chain
names, each off-chain name is owned by an address, and is associated with a
corresponding DNS zone file. A resolvable Stacks DID can be derived for any
existing off-chain name by concatenating two pieces of information:

- The address of the subdomain owner, e.g.
  `SJB53GD600EMEM74DFMA0B61JN8D8C4VE4M8NJRP`
- The identifier of the Stacks transaction (created by a on-chain name owner)
  which anchored the batch of operations including the subdomain creation on
  the Stacks blockchain, e.g.
  `ca2c2398b017d6d4c0e3e58b3807a648ebd5e15e1e1ce98649bab7bda044cf37`

Please note that the Stacks address of the subdomain owner is encoded using a
different version byte (and subsequently starts with a different prefix)
compared to an on-chain address (as documented in section
[2.2](#22-address-encoding)).

The resulting did -
`did:stack:v2:SJB53GD600EMEM74DFMA0B61JN8D8C4VE4M8NJRP-ca2c2398b017d6d4c0e3e58b3807a648ebd5e15e1e1ce98649bab7bda044cf37`
contains enough information to map it to one corresponding off-chain BNS name
during the resolution process (as described in section 3.3). The BNS contract,
in combination with the Gaia storage network, can be used to retrieve and
verify the public keys associated with the off-chain name (and by extension the
DID) during the resolution process (as outlined in section 3.2).

# 2. Stacks DID Method

The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: `stack:v2`

A DID that uses this method *MUST* begin with the following literal prefix:
`did:stack:v2`.  The remainder of the DID is its method-specific identifier.

## 2.1 Method-Specific Identifier

The method-specific identifier of the Stacks DID encodes two pieces of
information: a Stacks address, and a Stacks transaction identifier.

The **address** shall be a
[c32check](https://github.com/blockstack/c32check#c32check) encoding of a
version byte concatenated with the RIPEMD160 hash of a SHA256 hash of a
DER-encoded secp256k1 public key.  For example, in this Javascript snippet:

``` javascript
const crypto = require('crypto')
const RIPEMD160 = require('ripemd160')
const c32check = require('c32check')

const pubkey = Buffer.from(
  '042bc8aa4eb54d779c1fb8a2d5022aec8ed7fc2cc34d57356d9e1c417ce416773f45b0299ea7be347d14c69c403d9a03c8ec0ccf47533b4bee8cd002e5de81f945',
  'hex'
)

const sha256Pubkey = crypto.createHash('sha256')
  .update(pubkey)
  .digest('hex');

const ripemd160Sha256Pubkey = new RIPEMD160()
  .update(Buffer.from(sha256Pubkey, 'hex'))
  .digest('hex')

const versionByte = 22

const address = c32check.c32address(versionByte, ripemd160Sha256Pubkey)
// SPB53GD600EMEM74DFMA0B61JN8D8C4VE7D2ZSJ9
```

The **transaction identifier** shall reference a valid Stacks blockchain
transaction which registered the underlying BNS name. As elaborated on in later
sections, the referenced transaction is expected to encode a
[`name-register`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L609),
[`name-update`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L657),
or
[`name-import`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L438)
call to the BNS contract.

## 2.2 Address Encoding

The address's version byte encodes whether or not a DID corresponds to an
on-chain BNS name or an off-chain BNS subdomain, and whether the name has been
registered on the Stacks mainnet or testnet.  The version bytes for the
possible configurations are:

- On-chain names on mainnet: `0x16` (decimal value 22)
- On-chain names on testnet: `0x1a` (decimal value 26)
- Off-chain names on mainnet: `0x11` (decimal value 17)
- Off-chain names on testnet: `0x12` (decimal value 18)

For example, the RIPEMD160 hash `1651c1a6001d4750e46be8a02cc19550d4309b71`
derived in the previous snippet would encode to the following c32Check strings
depending on the address type:

- On-chain mainnet: `SPB53GD600EMEM74DFMA0B61JN8D8C4VE7D2ZSJ9`
- On-chain testnet: `STB53GD600EMEM74DFMA0B61JN8D8C4VE5477MXR`
- Off-chain mainnet: `SHB53GD600EMEM74DFMA0B61JN8D8C4VE6DHF2QF`
- Off-chain testnet: `SJB53GD600EMEM74DFMA0B61JN8D8C4VE4M8NJRP`

The version bytes for the various address types are also documented
[here](../src/constants.ts#L33).

# 3. Stacks DID Operations

## 3.1 Creating a Stacks DID

As mentioned in sections [1.2](#12-on-chain-dids) and
[1.3](#13-off-chain-dids), a Stacks DID can be derived given any valid BNS name
(off-chain or on-chain). Due to this one-to-one mapping between BNS names and
Stacks DIDs, the process of creating a Stacks DID is reduced to simply
registering the underlying BNS name.

The following subsections will describe how on-chain and off-chain BNS names
can be registered.

### 3.1.1 On-chain names

Instantiating an on-chain name requires two calls to the BNS smart contract:

1. First a call to the
[`name-preorder`](notion://www.notion.so/jolocom/%3Chttps://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L581%3E)
function needs to be made. This transaction commits to a salted hashed name and
burns the required registration fee (depends on the name / namespace).
2. Once the preorder transaction has been processed and accepted by the
network, a
[`name-register`](notion://www.notion.so/jolocom/.%3Chttps://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L609/%3E)
function call can be made to finalize the registration process. This
transaction reveals the salt and the registered name to the network. If the
operation succeeds, the BNS contract state will be updated to include a new
entry, mapping the newly registered name to it's owner's address, and to it's
current DNS zone file.

Once the name has been registered, a resolvable Stacks DID can be derived by
combining the Stacks address of the name owner (the sender of the
[`name-register`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L609)
transaction), and the identifier of the
[`name-register`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L609)
transaction which registered the name.

Stacks supplies a [reference
library](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks.js/tree/master/packages/bns)
which allows developers to easily interact with the BNS smart contract (e.g.
for the purpose of registering an on-chain name). For a usage example, see [the
relevant test files](../tests/integration/setup.ts#L30) in the Stacks DID
resolver repository.

### 3.1.2 Registering off-chain names

Unlike an on-chain name, a subdomain owner needs an on-chain name owner's help
to broadcast their subdomain operations. In particular, a subdomain creation
transaction can only be processed by the owner of the on-chain name that shares
its suffix. For example, only the owner of `example.id` can broadcast
subdomain-creation transactions for subdomain names ending in `.example.id`.
This is because the zone file related to / describing the subdomain
(`demo.example.id`) is included / nested in the zone file of the name owner
(`example.id`).

To register an off-chain name, the user must submit a request to the
corresponding off-chain registrar. Anyone with an on-chain name can operate
such a registrar.  A reference registrar implementation can be found
[here](https://github.com/blockstack/subdomain-registrar).

To register an off-chain DID, the user must submit a JSON body as a HTTP POST
request to the registrar's registration endpoint with the following format:

``` { "zonefile": "<zonefile encoding the location of the DDO>", "name":
"<off-chain name, excluding the on-chain suffix>", "owner_address":
"<b58check-encoded address that will own the name, with version byte \\x00>", }

```

For example, to register the name `demo` on a registrar for `example.id`:

``` $ curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: bearer API-KEY-IF-USED' -H 'Content-Type:
application/json' \\
> --data '{"zonefile": "$ORIGIN demo\\n$TTL 3600\\n_https._tcp URI 10 1
> \\"<https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1HgW81v6MxGD76UwNbHXBi6Zre2fK8TwNi/profile.json\\"\\n">,
> \\ "name": "demo", \\ "owner_address": "1HgW81v6MxGD76UwNbHXBi6Zre2fK8TwNi"}'
> \\ <http://localhost:3000/register/>

```

The `zonefile` field must be a well-formed DNS zone file, and must have the
following properties (the same structure applies to zone files describing
on-chain names):

- It must have its `$ORIGIN` field set to the off-chain name.
- It must have at least one `URI` resource record that encodes an HTTP or HTTPS
  URL. Note that its name must be either `_http._tcp` or `_https._tcp`, per the
  `URI` record specification.
- The HTTP or HTTPS URL must resolve to a JSON Web token signed by a secp256k1
  public key that hashes to the `owner_address` field (as briefly described in
  section 1.2).

The registrar will collect multiple such requests from subdomain owners before
broadcasting a new batch of updates. It can do this by composing a new zone
file which includes all received subdomain operations, replicating it, and
setting a new zone file hash with a
[`name-update`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L657)
transaction. This essentially replicates all subdomain operations contained in
the zone file, and anchors the the operations to an on-chain transaction.

The BNS node's consensus rules ensure that only valid subdomain operations from
valid
[`name-register`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L609),
[`name-update`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L657)
or
[`name-import`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L438)
transactions will ever be stored.

As mentioned in section [1.3](#13-off-chain-dids), a resolvable off-chain
Stacks DID can be derived for any registered subdomain by combining the Stacks
address of the subdomain owner, and the identifier of the Stacks transaction
which anchored the subdomain creation operation.

Stacks provides a reference implementation of a [subdomain
registrar](https://github.com/blockstack/subdomain-registrar) service which can
be easily operated by any on-chain BNS name owner to allow for the registration
of subdomains.

## 3.2 Resolving a Stacks DID

Resolving Stacks DIDs happens with the aid of the aforementioned BNS smart
contract and the Gaia storage network. The resolution process can be
generalized to the following main steps:

1. First, the data encoded in the [Stacks DID's
NSI](#21-method-specific-identifier) is used to map it to an underlying BNS
name / subdomain.  In addition to on-chain and off-chain names defined in the
previous sections, a Stacks DID can also map to a migrated name (not elaborated
on in the following subsections, but described in section
[3.5](#35-migration-and-compatibility-with-blockstack-v1-dids)).
2. Once the DID was mapped to a BNS name / subdomain, a number of checks need
to be performed to ensure that the underlying name is still valid. In case the
name was revoked or expired, the DID is considered deactivated, and the
resolution process fails with the corresponding error.
3. If the BNS name / subdomain is not revoked or expired, the Stacks network is
queried for the most up to date associated zone file. In case any ownership
change operations / key rotation (i.e.
[`name-transfer`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L679)
transactions for on-chain names, or
[`name-update`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L657)
operations for off-chain names) were broadcasted for the underlying BNS name /
subdomain since the creation of the DID, the changes will be reflected in the
latest name state. The most recent public keys associated with the DID will be
returned as a result of this step.

To summarize, as part of the resolution process a Stacks DID is mapped to a BNS
name / subdomain, which is in turn resolved to it's most up to date owner and
set of public keys. The resolved keys in combination with the DID can then be
used to assemble and return a valid DID Document.

The individual steps are described in more detail in the following subsections.

### 3.2.1 Mapping a DID to a BNS name

First, the [Stacks DID's NSI](#21-method-specific-identifier) is parsed, and
the encoded Stacks address and Stacks transaction identifier are extracted. The
Stacks transaction identifier is used to query a Stacks blockchain client for
the full transaction data (e.g. by using the corresponding [HTTP API
endpoint](https://blockstack.github.io/stacks-blockchain-api/#operation/get_transaction_by_id)).

The retrieved transaction object is expected include a contract call to one of
the following BNS smart contract functions:

- `name-register` - used to register a on-chain or off-chain name (depending on
  the contents of the associated zone file).
- `name-import` - used to register a on-chain or off-chain name (depending on
  the contents of the associated zone file).
- `name-update` - can be used to register a off-chain name.

All three transactions listed above are expected to include the following
function call arguments:

- `name` - the BNS name being registered (e.g. "example").
- `namespace` - the namespace to which the name belongs (e.g. "id").
- `zonefile-hash` - the hash of the DNS zone file associated with the name.

The Gaia storage network can be used to retrieve the zone file using the
`zonefile-hash` extracted from the transaction. The retrieved `zonefile` is
expected to contain a `$ORIGIN` directive, matching the `name` and `namespace`
values extracted from the transaction object.

The zone file may also include one or more `TXT` resource records which encode
further zone files associated with subdomains registered under this BNS `name`.
Each `TXT` resource record is expected to encode a zone file for the subdomain,
as well as the address of the subdomain owner (as documented
[here](https://docs.stacks.co/build-apps/references/bns#subdomains)).

As described in section [2.2](#22-address-encoding), a Stacks DID encodes a
Stacks address, which subsequently includes a version byte denoting whether the
DID is associated with an on-chain or off-chain BNS name. If the DID is
associated with an on-chain name, the DID is mapped to the `name` and
`namespace` encoded in the transaction object (as well as the `$ORIGIN`
directive), and the `TXT` records (if present) are ignored.

If the DID is associated with an off-chain name, the corresponding zone file is
expected to be encoded in one the included `TXT` resource records. The relevant
entry is expected to list the `address` (specified in the Stacks DID NSI) in
the `owner` field. In case the entry is found, the DID is mapped to the
`subdomain` (retrieved from the zone file), `name` and `namespace` (extracted
from the registration transaction), otherwise resolution fails with the
appropriate error.

Before the mapped BNS name can be returned, the signed JSON Web Token
referenced in the relevant zone file needs to be retrieved, and the included
public key used to verify the associated signature. If the signature verifies
correctly, and the included public key hashes to the `address` encoded in the
DID's NSI, this step completes successfully, and the corresponding BNS name is
returned, otherwise resolution fails with an error.

### 3.2.2 Ensuring the DID is not deactivated

As outlined in section [3.4](#34-deactivating-a-stacks-did), a Stacks DID can
be deactivated by revoking the underlying BNS name. Deactivated DIDs should no
longer resolve to DID Documents / public keys (also revoked BNS names can not
be reassigned or updated in the future, rendering the DID unusable).

For on-chain names, the revocation status is tracked by the BNS smart contract
(as can [be seen
here](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L92))
and can be triggered by calling the [corresponding contract
function](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L712),
while for off-chain names, revocation is expressed by transferring the name to
a "nothing-up-my-sleeve" address (as elaborated on in section
[3.4](#34-deactivating-a-stacks-did)), for which no one has the appropriate
private key.

Once the DID has been mapped to the underlying BNS name and the latest name
state is retrieved, depending on the type of DID being resolved (on-chain or
off-chain), the appropriate revocation check is performed.

Furthermore, BNS names can also expire, and need to be periodically renewed.
The expiration time for an on-chain name depends on the [namespace it is
registered
under](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L65),
and is tracked and enforced by the BNS contract.

In case the name is revoked or is expired, resolution fails with the
appropriate error, otherwise the process continues.

### 3.2.3 Resolving the DID to the latest set of keys

The last step in the resolution process consists of mapping the BNS name (and
by extension DID) to it's latest owner and set of public keys. As described in
section [3.3](#33-updating-a-stacks-did), the keys associated with a Stacks DID
can be rotated after the DID was created (e.g. by issuing a
[`name-transfer`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L679)
operation designating a new owner in case of an on-chain name).

To fetch the latest keys, the Stacks network is queried for the most up to date
zone file associated with the BNS name retrieved in step
[3.2.1](#321-mapping-a-did-to-a-bns-name). The zone file is parsed, and the
included `URI` resource record is extracted. As mentioned previously, the
record is expected to encode a HTTP or HTTPS URL, which resolves to a JSON Web
token signed by a secp256k1 public key that hashes to the current name owner.
The appropriate verification steps are performed, and if the signature
verification succeeds, and the key hashes to the current owner, it is returned,
otherwise resolution fails with the appropriate error.

### 3.2.4 Generating a DID Document for a Stacks DID

Once the steps outlined above have been completed, the resolved public key(s),
together with the DID, can be used to generate a well-formed DID Document "on
the fly" and return it to the client.

## 3.3 Updating a Stacks DID

The owner / public keys associated with a BNS name (and by extension a Stacks
DID) can be rotated by assembling and broadcasting the corresponding name
update / ownership transfer operations. The following subsections will describe
the process of updating the keys associated with on-chain or off-chain names.

### 3.3.1 Updating an on-chain Stacks DID

The keys associated with an on-chain BNS name / DID can be rotated by
transferring the ownership of the name to a different address. In order to
accomplish this, a
[`name-transfer`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L679)
transaction can be assembled and broadcasted. Once the transaction is confirmed
by the Stacks network, the public keys associated with a BNS name (and by
extension with the on-chain DID) key will be updated. As described in section
[3.2.3](#323-resolving-the-did-to-the-latest-set-of-keys), during the
resolution process these transactions will be taken into account, and the
latest designated set of keys will be associated with the Stacks DID.

Stacks supplies a [reference
library](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks.js/tree/master/packages/bns)
enabling developers to easily interact with the BNS contract in order to
transfer a BNS name. For examples on how to use the library to update a
on-chain Stacks DIDs, consult the [following test
files](../tests/integration/registrar/name.ts#L70) in the Stacks DID resolver
repository.

### 3.3.2 Updating an off-chain DID

If the DID corresponds to an off-chain name, then the user must request that
the registrar that instantiated the name broadcasts an off-chain name transfer
operation.  To do so, the user must submit a string with the following format
to the registrar:

``` ${name} TXT "owner=${new_address}" "seqn=${update_counter}"
"parts=${length_of_zonefile_base64}" "zf0=${base64_part_0}"
"zf1=${base64_part_1}" ... "sig=${base64_signature}"

```

The string is a well-formed DNS TXT record with the following fields:

- The `${name}` field is the subdomain name without the on-chain suffix (e.g.
  `demo` in `demo.example.id`.
- The `${new_address}` field is the new owner address of the subdomain name.
- The `${update_counter}` field is a non-negative integer equal to the number
  of subdomain name operations that have occurred so far. It starts with 0 when
  the name is created, and must increment each time the name owner issues an
  off-chain name operation.
- The `${length_of_zonefile_base64}` field is equal to the length of the
  base64-encoded zone file for the off-chain name.
- The fields `zf0`, `zf1`, `zf2`, etc. and their corresponding variables
  `${base64_part_0}`, `${base64_part_1}`, `${base64_part_2}`, etc. correspond
  to 256-byte segments of the base64-encoded zone file. They must occur in a
  sequence of `zf${n}` where `${n}` starts at 0 and increments by 1 until all
  segments of the zone file are represented.
- The `${base64_signature}` field is a secp256k1 signature over the resulting
  string, up to the `sig=` field, and base64-encoded. The signature must come
  from the secp256k1 private key that currently owns the name.

Thus to generate this TXT record for their DID, the user would do the
following:

1. Base64-encode the off-chain DID's zone file.
2. Break the base64-encoded zone file into 256-byte segments.
3. Assemble the TXT record from the name, new address, update counter, and zone
file segments.
4. Sign the resulting string with the DID's current private key.
5. Generate and append the `sig=${base64_signature}` field to the TXT record.

For example, the Python 2 program here generates such a TXT record:

```python
import blockstack

offchain_name = 'bar'
onchain_name = 'foo.test'
new_address = '1Jq3x8BAYz9Xy9AMfur5PXkDsWtmBBsNnC'
seqn = 1
privk = 'da1182302fee950e64241a4103646992b1bed7f6c4ced858282e493d57df33a501'
full_name = '{}.{}'.format(offchain_name, onchain_name)
zonefile = "$ORIGIN {}\n$TTL 3600\n_http._tcp\tIN\tURI\t10\t1\t\"https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/{}/profile.json\"\n\n".format(offchain_name, new_address)

print blockstack.lib.subdomains.make_subdomain_txt(full_name, onchain_name, new_address, seqn, zonefile, privk)
```

The program prints a string such as:

```
bar TXT "owner=1Jq3x8BAYz9Xy9AMfur5PXkDsWtmBBsNnC" "seqn=1" "parts=1" "zf0=JE9SSUdJTiBiYXIKJFRUTCAzNjAwCl9odHRwLl90Y3AJSU4JVVJJCTEwCTEJImh0dHBzOi8vZ2FpYS5ibG9ja3N0YWNrLm9yZy9odWIvMUpxM3g4QkFZejlYeTlBTWZ1cjVQWGtEc1d0bUJCc05uQy9wcm9maWxlLmpzb24iCgo\=" "sig=QEA+88Nh6pqkXI9x3UhjIepiWEOsnO+u1bOBgqy+YyjrYIEfbYc2Q8YUY2n8sIQUPEO2wRC39bHQHAw+amxzJfkhAxcC/fZ0kYIoRlh2xPLnYkLsa5k2fCtXqkJAtsAttt/V"
```

(Note that the `sig=` field will differ between invocations, due to the way
ECDSA signatures work).

Once this TXT record has been submitted to the name's original registrar, the
registrar will pack it along with other such records into a single zone file,
and issue a `name-update` transaction for the on-chain name to announce them to
the rest of the peer network.  The registrar will then propagate these TXT
records to the peer network once the transaction confirms, thereby informing
all Stacks nodes of the new state of the off-chain DID.

## 3.4 Deactivating a Stacks DID

If the user wants to deactivate their DID, they can do so by revoking the
underlying BNS name. The process is implemented slightly differently depending
on whether an on-chain or an off-chain name is being revoked, as described
below.

To revoke an on-chain name, the current owner can construct and broadcast a
[`name-revoke`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/bns.clar#L712)
transaction signed with the appropriate key. Once the transaction is processed
and accepted by the Stacks network, the BNS contract state will be updated to
list the on-chain name as revoked. Attempting to resolve a Stacks DID based on
a revoked name will result in an error (as described in section
[3.2.2](#322-ensuring-the-did-is-not-deactivated)).

In order to deactivate an off-chain name, the user can construct and broadcasts
a TXT record for the DID's underlying name that (1) changes the owner address
to a "nothing-up-my-sleeve" address (e.g. `1111111111111111111114oLvT2` -- the
base58-check encoding of 20 bytes of 0's), and (2) changes the zone file to
include an unresolvable URL.  This prevents the DID from resolving, and
prevents it from being updated in the future.

## 3.5 Migration and compatibility with Stacks v1 DIDs

The previous iteration of the Stacks `did:stack:` DID method ([defined
here](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/stacks-1.0/docs/blockstack-did-spec.md#blockstack-did-method-specification))
allows users to derive a valid, resolvable `did:stack:` DID given a BNS name
they own, similarly to the approach outlined in this document.

Both the `did:stack` and `did:stack:v2` DID methods are build around the BNS
naming layer (although different iterations of it) to enable the resolution of
a DID to a set of public keys via a BNS name.

As described in the [BNS
documentation](https://docs.stacks.co/build-apps/references/bns), the Stacks v1
blockchain implemented BNS through first-order name operations (written to the
underlying chain). In Stacks V2, the name system is instead implemented through
a smart-contract loaded during the genesis block. The initial state of the BNS
contract includes all names registered using the previous iteration of the
Stacks naming system.

Any valid *on-chain* v1 DID (e.g.
`did:stack:v0:15gxXgJyT5tM5A4Cbx99nwccynHYsBouzr-3`) can be easily updated to a
valid, resolvable on-chain Stacks DID by updating the NSI part of the DID in
accordance with the structure defined in this document.

The general migration steps for such a DID are:

1. Replace the `did:stack:v0` DID Method identifier with `did:stack:v2`.
2. Extract the `address` and `index` values encoded in the NSI.
2. Re-encode the base58 encoded `address` using c32check (e.g. as implemented
in the [following
module](https://github.com/blockstack/c32check#c32tob58-b58toc32))
3. Discard the `index` value. In the new BNS system each principal can only
hold one on-chain name. The `index` part of the NSI needs to be replaced with
the identifier of the Stacks transaction which registered the name.
4. Given that the name record was migrated (i.e. included in the initial state
of the BNS contract during deployment, and not registered using a
`name-update`, `name-import`, etc. transaction) no Stacks transaction ID is
available to uniquely reference the registration. Instead, the identifier of
the contract deployment transaction can be used. The exact transaction
identifiers are listed [here](../src/constants.ts#L9).

Following the process described above, the example
`did:stack:v0:15gxXgJyT5tM5A4Cbx99nwccynHYsBouzr-3` on-chain Stacks DID
would be converted to
`did:stack:v2:SPSPY51G2MRRM6Q57Y67CDS2X293D8WTGV4V3GE2-d8a9a4528ae833e1894eee676af8d218f8facbf95e166472df2c1a64219b5dfb`

In order to migrate an *off-chain* v1 Stacks DID, the off-chain name owner
must request that the registrar that instantiated the name broadcasts a
`name-update` operation anchoring the zone file. The identifier of the
`name-update` operation can then be concatenated with the address of the
off-chain name owner to produce a resolvable off-chain Stacks DID. This
additional step is required because there is no way to uniquely identify an
off-chain name imported during contract deployment using only the subdomain
owner address. Additional information (specifically the name with which the
subdomain is associated) which is not part of the DID's NSI would be required.

As part of the DID resolution process, when a DID is mapped to it's underling
BNS name, before the process defined in section
[3.2.1](#321-mapping-a-did-to-a-bns-name) takes place, the transaction
identifier encoded in the DID's NSI is compared with the aforementioned BNS
deployment transaction identifier. In case they match, the resolver attempts to
map the DID to a migrated BNS name. This is achieved by calling a function on
an auxiliary, helper, clarity smart contract deployed for this purpose (the
source for the contract can be [found here](./proxy-contract.clar), and the
on-chain [addresses here](../src/constants.ts#L34)). As can be seen from the
contract source, it makes a call to the BNS contract to get the name associated
with a Stacks address, making use of the
[`at-block`](https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-functions#at-block)
function to ensure the call is evaluated as if it were made at the end of the
first block. At block height 1 the BNS contract is already deployed (and it's
state contains all migrated names), but no new names have been registered yet,
therefore all resolution operations are restricted to migrated names only.

In case the contract call returns a migrated BNS name, the resolution process
continues with step [3.2.2](#322-ensuring-the-did-is-not-deactivated),
otherwise resolution fails with an error.

# 4. Security Considerations

This section briefly outlines possible ways to attack the Stacks DID method,
as well as countermeasures the Stacks protocol and the user can take to
defend against them.

## 4.1 Public Blockchain Attacks

Stacks operates on top of a public blockchain, which could be attacked by a
sufficiently powerful adversary -- such as rolling back and changing the
chain's transaction history, denying new transactions for Stacks name
operations, or eclipsing nodes.

Stacks makes the first two attacks difficult by operating on top of the
most secure blockchain -- currently Bitcoin.  If the blockchain is attacked, or
a stronger blockchain comes into being, the Stacks community would migrate
the Stacks network to a new blockchain.

The underlying blockchain provides some immunity towards eclipse attacks, since
a blockchain peer expects blocks to arrive at roughly fixed intervals and
expects blocks to have a proof of an expenditure of an expensive resource (like
electricity).  In Bitcoin's case, the computational difficulty of finding new
blocks puts a high lower bound on the computational effort required to eclipse
a Bitcoin node -- in order to sustain 10-minute block times, the attacker must
expend an equal amount of energy as the rest of the network.  Moreover, the
required expenditure rate (the "chain difficulty") decreases slowly enough that
an attacker with less energy would have to spend months of time on the attack,
giving the victim ample time to detect it.  The countermeasures the blockchain
employs to deter eclipse attacks are beyond the scope of this document, but it
is worth pointing out that Stacks' DID method benefits from them since
they also help ensure that DID creation, updates and deletions get processed in
a timely manner.

## 4.2 Stacks Peer Network Attacks

Because Stacks stores each DID's DDO's URL in its own peer network outside
of its underlying blockchain, it is possible to eclipse Stacks nodes and
prevent them from seeing both off-chain DID operations and updates to on-chain
DIDs.  In an effort to make this as difficult as possible, the Stacks peer
network implements an unstructured overlay network -- nodes select a random
sample of the peer graph as their neighbors.  Moreover, Stacks nodes strive
to fetch a full replica of all zone files, and pull zone files from their
neighbors in rarest-first order to prevent zone files from getting lost while
they are propagating.  This makes eclipsing a node maximally difficult -- an
attacker would need to disrupt all of a the victim node's neighbor links.

In addition to this protocol-level countermeasure, a user has the option of
uploading zone files manually to their preferred Stacks nodes.  If
vigilant users have access to a replica of the zone files, they can re-seed
Stacks nodes that do not have them.

## 4.3 Stale Data and Replay Attacks

A DID's DDO is stored on a 3rd party storage provider.  The DDO's public key is
anchored to the blockchain, which means each time the DDO public key changes,
all previous DDOs are invalidated.  Similarly, the DDO's storage provider URLs
are anchored to the blockchain, which means each time the DID's zone file
changes, any stale DDOs will no longer be fetched.  However, if the user
changes other fields of their DDO, a malicious storage provider or a network
adversary can serve a stale but otherwise valid DDO and the resolver will
accept it.

The user has a choice of which storage providers host their DDO.  If the
storage provider serves stale data, the user can and should change their
storage provider to one that will serve only fresh data.  In addition, the user
should use secure transport protocols like HTTPS to make replay attacks on the
network difficult.  For use cases where these are not sufficient to prevent
replay attacks, the user should change their zone file and/or public key each
time they change their DDO.

# 5. Privacy Considerations

Stacks DIDs are underpinned by BNS namess (human readable names), and
every Stacks node records where every DID's DDO is hosted. However, users
have the option of encrypting their DDOs so that only a select set of other
users can decrypt them.

Stacks peer network and DID resolver use HTTP(S), meaning that
intermediate middleboxes like CDNs and firewalls can cache data and log
requests.

# 6. Reference Implementations

Stacks nodes implement and expose a [RESTful API](https://blockstack.github.io/stacks-blockchain-api) for
querying DIDs. It also implements a [reference
library](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks.js/tree/master/packages/bns) for generating
well-formed on-chain transactions, and it implements a [reference registrar](https://github.com/blockstack/subdomain-registrar)
for generating and publishing off-chain DID operations. The Stacks node [reference
implementation](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/) is available
under the terms of the General Public Licence, version 3.
